### The Corrected Proof

Here is the corrected logical flow.

## What the Premise Tells Us

The premise is that Ax = 0 has a nonzero solution.

* This means the nullspace of A is non-trivial.
* For a matrix A with n columns, this occurs only when the columns are linearly dependent.
* This directly implies that the rank of the matrix is less than the number of columns.
    rank(A) < n

## What Would Be Required for a Solution to Always Exist

Now, consider the system: Aᵀy = f.

* For this system to be solvable for every possible vector f, the columns of Aᵀ must span the entire target space.
* If A is an m x n matrix, then Aᵀ is n x m. The vector f is in Rⁿ.
* For the columns of Aᵀ to span all of Rⁿ, their dimension (the rank) must be n. The condition would be:
    rank(Aᵀ) = n

---

## The Contradiction

Now we can see the conflict.

* From the premise, we proved that rank(A) < n.
* We know for a fact that rank(A) = rank(Aᵀ).
* Combining these, we get rank(Aᵀ) < n.

This directly contradicts the condition required for Aᵀy = f to always have a solution (rank(Aᵀ) = n).

Since the rank is less than n, the column space of Aᵀ is just a subspace of Rⁿ and does not fill it entirely. 
Therefore, there must be vectors f outside of this subspace for which the equation has no solution.
